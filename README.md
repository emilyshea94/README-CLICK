# README-CLICK
For this project I cloned starter code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma and then modified it to create a readme generator.
The function of this README genreator is to have the user enter a command in the command line along with their github name and it then asks them a seriers of questions tothen create them a professional README.
The user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidlines, and test instructions.

I added code into the file index.js that included instructions for the README and added a function
Then i added "if" statements to the generateMarkdown.js 
I ran into a problem of my terminal in VScode not finding the index.js module so the README generator does not function properly.
